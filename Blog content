## Have you ever heard of the Iridium Effect? 
![Drawn_Satellite](Iridium_Effect.jpg) 


### If not - here is a short introduction: 
 
 
 The label **Iridium moment** has its origin from the late 1980s as the telecommunications giant motorola unfortunately made a serious strategic dumb decision due to incorrect assessments of future developments. Motorola recognized the coming boom in demand for cell phones, but underestimated the benefits of local radio towers. From Motorola's point of view, these were not sufficiently effective and were comparatively cost-intensive and limited to urban areas. They saw a great opportunity in the expansion of the satellite system and founded the company Iridium with the mission to provide mobile radio coverage all over the world. However, by the time the satellites were up and running, the assumptions on which the strategic decision to establish Iridium was based were no longer valid. By then, the range and performance of masts had improved dramatically and costs had decreased. The use of linear Tools and trends from the past led Motorola to incorrectly predict an accelerating future and thus thus shaped the expression **Irdidium moment**.

 It is not rare that wrong strategic decisions are made on the basis of wrong assumptions and estimates. In particular, the rapid advancement of technology and thus the establishment of mobile devices has led to many miscalculations. 

 | Statements from the 2000s that you wouldn't believe were actually said that way:| | 
 |--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------| 
 | Steve Jobs (2003): | *"The subscription model for music has failed"*|
 | Paul Krugman *(Nobel Prize winner, well-known economist, advisor to several U.S. presidents)* (1998): | *"The Internet will have no more impact on the economy than the fax machine did"* | 
 |Steve Ballmer *(Ex-CEO Microsoft)* (2007):| *"The iPhone will never gain a significant market share in its lifetime. Not a chance."*|


This shows that even the greatest visionaries and thinkers occasionally misjudge some of the rapid developments and the associated social change. 

Even large consulting firms, which are often hired for strategic orientation, have fallen victim to the Iridium effect. 
| For example, the consulting firm McKinsey once advised AT&T not to enter the cell phone business in the 1980s. This recommendation was based on the assumption that there would be less than one million cell phones in use in the year 2000, which, by the way, was off by a factor of 100 and resulted in AT&T missing a huge opportunity.|

## Reflection and Theoretical Approach to an exponential Age

If we take a look at the history of technological and social development, this may not be surprising: 

<span style="color:gray">**Task:** 
    Everyone is probably familiar with the situation where parents talk about the past and how crazy it is all that has happened in that time. Especially when stories are unwrapped about how they spent hours on the phone using a pay phone or then had their first computer. I'm 24 years old now and just reflecting I find myself in that amazement. The first real smartphones for the general population (no comparison to today of course) with internet access via tablets, flat screen TVs, IoT and smart homes and much more and now we are in the age of Metaverse. Take two minutes and realize what you have witnessed so far and what technologies of tomorrow are just around the corner. Hard to process, isn't it?</span>

**Brief Excursus:** 
I would like to introduce to you here two great thinkers Gordon Moore and Ray Kurzweil who have properly grasped and anchored the dynamics of developments in future ages within their laws. Since the understanding of Moore's Law and the Law of Accelerating Returns of Kurzweil is essential for the understanding how we entered the Exponential Age, a short theoretical excursus will be made in the following. 

1. **Moore's Law**

    In 1965, Gordon Moore made a prediction that set the pace for our modern digital revolution. From close observation of an emerging trend, Moore deduced a dramatic increase in computing power and a decrease in relative cost - on an exponential scale. And he was right! The exponential improvement he predicted was evident in the transformation of the first clumsy home computers of the 1970s into the sophisticated PCs and laptops of the 1980s and 1990s, leading from there to the rise of high-speed Internet, as well as the smartphones, Internet-connected cars, refrigerators and thermostatic valves we take for granted today.

    Simplified, [Moore’s Law](https://www.synopsys.com/glossary/what-is-moores-law.html) states that the price/performance ratio of computers is doubling every eighteen months.

2. **Kurzweil's Law of Accelerating Returns and further observations**

    Building on the duplication pattern identified by Moore, Kurzweil determined that this pheomenon applies to every information technology ([Law of Accelerating Returns](https://www.kurzweilai.net/the-law-of-accelerating-returns)) and proved this by analyzing computer technology up to the year 1990. He identified information as the driving force behind it. Once a field, discipline, technology or industry becomes information enabled and driven by information flows, the price/performance doubles approximately annually, and once that doubling starts, it doesn't stop. He cited artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, biotechnology and bioinformatics, medicine, neuroscience, data science, 3D printing, nanotechnology, and even aspects of energy as key technologies that are information-based and therefore follow the same trajectory

    Intersecting technologies accelerate the pace of innovation even further - as each crossover adds another multiplier to the equation.

So if we look back now at the tremendous upheavals that have taken place in the business world over the last 15 years, the next fifteen years will make those upheavals seem tame by comparison. 


### Deep dive new age of exponential world

#### Deriving from Kurzweil's and Moore's thinking, the new age is characterized by the following 2 major trends: 


| The speed with which new companies reach market capitalization has risen sharply, but the lifespan of company is going to become shorter and shorter. |
|--|

![Market_cap_to_a_Billion](Market_cap.png) 

Examples: YouTube went from a startup funded by Chad Hurley’s personal credit cards to being purchased by Google for $1.4 billion, all in less than eighteen months. Groupon leapt from conception to $6 billion in value in less than two years. Uber is valued at almost $17 billion, ten times its value of just two years ago.
- *In ten years, 40 percent of existing Fortune 500 Companies would no longer survive.*
- The Average lifespan of an S&P 500 company has decreased from sixty-seven years in the 1920s to fifteen years today. And that lifespan is going to get even shorter in the years.
- For example, a typical CPG (Consumer Packaged Goods) company like Johnson & Johnson or Proctor & Gamble takes about 300 days to go from a new idea to a product on a Walmart shelf. Quirky, a leading ExO, does that same process — new idea to product on a Walmart shelf — in just 29 days

#### All are affected
Of course, the growing speed also increases the complexity of how business models are built and structured today. But not only new companies, but also long-established ones have to adapt to this. Because not even giant companies are immune from being wiped out by what seems to be a new breed of companies overnight, harnessing the power of exponential technologies, from groupware and data mining to synthetic biology and robotics. This has been demonstrated by the inability to adapt in accordance with rapid change of entire one-great-industry-dominant companies like Kodak, Polaroid, Blockbuster, Nokia among others. 

In order to understand what it takes for businesses to adapt to the new age, we must first gain an understanding of what constitutes this new age: 

1. neither age nor size nor reputation nor even current sales guarantee that you will be around tomorrow
2. with a minimum of resources and time you can build an organization that is sufficiently scalable, fast moving and smart (compare Airbnb, Uber)

:arrow_right: **This new age calls for a different solution to building new business, to improving rates of success and to solving the challenges that lie ahead. It is clear, however, that in our information-based world that is developing exponentially, linear organizational structures cannot be adapted appropriately quickly and flexibly. 
 Therefore: There must be a better way to organize! - An exponential one!**

# New breed of institutional organism: *the exponential organization(ExO)*

## Definition:
An Exponential Organization (ExO) is one *"whose <span style="color:red">impact (or output) is disproportionally large—at least 10x larger—compared to its peers</span> because of the use of new organizational techniques that leverage accelerating technologies"* (Ismail, 2014). :rocket:

Rather than using armies of people or large physical plants, Exponential Organizations are built upon information technologies that take what was once physical in nature and dematerialize it into the digita

 :arrow_right: Two main assumptions: 
 1. Access resources you don’t own --> leverage external resources , rather than owning assets or workforces
 2. Information is your greatest asset.

 |The core notion is simple: Rather than increasing human capital or physical assets, the most successful 21st-century companies leverage information and technology to achieve rapid expansion in pursuit of a "Massive Transformational Purpose" (MTP). In doing so, they're able to scale their business strategies, culture, organizational frameworks and purpose at the same rate as the technology, i.e. one that follows an exponential curve.|

**Further characteristics:** :rocket:
--> Salim Ismail and his co-researchers have studied around 100 companies which has exponentially grown in the last five years and identified the common traits across all the exponential organizations as shown below:
- ExOs are built upon <span style="color:red">information technologies</span> that take what was once physical in nature and dematerialize it into the digital, on-demand world.

- <span style="color:red">**Massive Transformative Purpose**</span> is the answer to why you do what you do, why you get up in the morning, and why your organization exists and goes beyond just the mission statement by reflecting an organization’s aspiration -> ExOs are focused on transforming the world for a better future *(not only on economic profit)*
