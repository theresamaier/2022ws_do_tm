### Have you ever heard of the Iridium Effect? 
#### If not - here is a short introduction: 
 
 
 The expression **Iridium effect** has its origin from the late 1980s as the telecommunications giant motorola unfortunately made a serious strategic dumb decision due to incorrect assessments of future developments. Motorola recognized the coming boom in demand for cell phones, but underestimated the benefits of local radio towers. From Motorola's point of view, these were not sufficiently effective and were comparatively cost-intensive and limited to urban areas. They saw a great opportunity in the expansion of the satellite system and founded the company Iridium with the mission to provide mobile radio coverage all over the world. However, by the time the satellites were up and running, the assumptions on which the strategic decision to establish Iridium was based were no longer valid. By then, the range and performance of masts had improved dramatically and costs had decreased. The use of linear Tools and trends from the past led Motorola to incorrectly predict an accelerating future and thus thus shaped the expression **Irdidium Effect**.

 It is not rare that wrong strategic decisions are made on the basis of wrong assumptions and estimates. In particular, the rapid advancement of technology and thus the establishment of mobile devices has led to many miscalculations. 

 | Statements from the 2000s that you wouldn't believe were actually said that way:| | 
 |--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------| 
 | Steve Jobs (2003): | *"The subscription model for music has failed"*|
 | Paul Krugman *(Nobel Prize winner, well-known economist, advisor to several U.S. presidents)* (1998): | *"The Internet will have no more impact on the economy than the fax machine did"* | 
 |Steve Ballmer *(Ex-CEO Microsoft)* (2007):| *"The iPhone will never gain a significant market share in its lifetime. Not a chance."*|


This shows that even the greatest visionaries and thinkers occasionally misjudge some of the rapid developments and the associated social change. 

Even large consulting firms, which are often consulted for strategic orientation, have fallen victim to the Iridium effect. 
| For example, the consulting firm McKinsey once advised AT&T not to enter the cell phone business in the 1980s. This recommendation was based on the assumption that there would be less than one million cell phones in use in the year 2000, which, by the way, was off by a factor of 100 and resulted in AT&T missing a huge opportunity.|
