## Statements from the 2000s that you wouldn't believe were actually said that way:

|Person| *Statement*|
 --------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------| 
 | Paul Krugman *(Nobel Prize winner, well-known economist, advisor to several U.S. presidents)* (1998): | *"The Internet will have no more impact on the economy than the fax machine did"* | 
 |Steve Ballmer *(Ex-CEO Microsoft)* (2007):| *"The iPhone will never gain a significant market share in its lifetime. Not a chance."*|

### Theoretical Approach to an exponential Age

**Moore's Law**: *The price/performance ratio of computers is doubling every eighteen months*

**Kurzweil's Law of Accelerating Returns**: phenomenon applies to every information technology
* Once a field, discipline, technology or industry becomes information enabled and driven by information flows, the price/performance doubles approximately annually, and once that doubling starts, it doesn't stop.
* Intersecting technologies accelerate the pace of innovation even further

## New breed of institutional organism: *the exponential organization(ExO)*

| Definition:|
|--|
An Exponential Organization (ExO :rocket:) is one *"whose impact (or output) is disproportionally large—at least 10x larger—compared to its peers because of the use of new organizational techniques that leverage accelerating technologies"* (Ismail, 2014).

➡️ There are two major assumptions on which this new way of running businesses is built:

1. "Rent, Don’t own/ Access resources you don’t own": ExOs rather use external resources than owning their own assets or workforce.

2. "Information accelerates everything and is therefore your greatest asset". (information-based environment delivers fundamentally disruptive opportunities)

## ExO characteristics 
ExO formula: MTP + IDEAS + SCALE

## Examples of MTPs: 
- Google: *"Organizing world’s information"*
- Airbnb: *"Everyone belongs everywhere"*
- TED: *"Ideas worth spreading"*
- Tesla: *"Accelerate the transition to sustainable transportation"*
- Uber: *"Transportation as reliable as running water"*
