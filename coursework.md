## Have you ever heard of the Iridium Moment?

Statements from the 2000s that you wouldn't believe were actually said that way:

 | Person| *Statement*|
 |--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------| 
  | Steve Jobs (2003): | *"The subscription model for music has failed"*|
 | Paul Krugman *(Nobel Prize winner, well-known economist, advisor to several U.S. presidents)* (1998): | *"The Internet will have no more impact on the economy than the fax machine did"* | 
 |Steve Ballmer *(Ex-CEO Microsoft)* (2007):| *"The iPhone will never gain a significant market share in its lifetime. Not a chance."*|

## Theoretical Approach to an exponential Age

 **Moore's Law** the price/performance ratio of computers is doubling every eighteen months

     Kurzweil's Law of Accelerating Returns and further observations
phenomenon applies to every information technology </sub>
- Once a field, discipline, technology or industry becomes information enabled and driven by information flows, the price/performance doubles approximately annually, and once that doubling starts, it doesn't stop.
- Intersecting technologies accelerate the pace of innovation even further - as each crossover adds another multiplier to the equation.

## Example
Lets look at google.

They developed the [exponential Organization](https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/what-is-an-exponential-organization/341439).

#intro

What have these brands in common? 
- Kodak
- Polaroid
- Blockbuster
- Nokia
Answer: all of these one-great-industry-dominant companies that were unable to adapt to rapid technological change 

*Iridium moment* --> using linear tools and the trends of the past to predict an accelerating future.

# New breed of institutional organism: *the exponential organization(ExO)*

### What circumstances have led to exponential progress becoming a survival factor for companies? 
1. neither age nor size nor reputation nor even current sales guarantee that you will be around tomorrow
2. with a minimum of resources and time you can build an organization that is sufficiently scalable, fast moving and smart (compare Airbnb, Uber)
3. Faced paced world: ([Kurzweil’s Law of Accelerating Returns](https://www.kurzweilai.net/the-law-of-accelerating-returns) and [Moore’s Law](https://www.synopsys.com/glossary/what-is-moores-law.html))
- *In ten years, 40 percent of existing Fortune 500 Companies would no longer survive.*
- The Average lifespan of an S&P 500 company has decreased from sixty-seven years in the 1920s to fifteen years today. And that lifespan is going to get even shorter in the years.

:arrow_right: **This new age calls for a different solution to building new business, to improving rates of success and to solving the challenges that lie ahead.
 Therefore: There must be a better way to organize! - An exponential one!**

## Definition:
An Exponential Organization (ExO) is one whose <span style="color:red">impact (or output) is disproportionally large—at least 10x larger—compared to its peers</span> because of the use of new organizational techniques that leverage accelerating technologies. :rocket:

 :arrow_right: Two main assumptions: 
 1. Access resources you don’t own
 2. Information is your greatest asset.

**Further characteristics:** :rocket:
- ExOs are built upon <span style="color:red">information technologies</span> that take what was once physical in nature and dematerialize it into the digital, on-demand world.

- <span style="color:red">**Massive Transformative Purpose**</span> that reflects an organization’s aspiration -> ExOs are focused on transforming the world for a better future *(not only on economic profit)*
- <span style="color:red">**IDEAS**</span> (internal attributes) 
    * <span style="color:red">**I**</span>nterfaces
    * <span style="color:red">**D**</span>ashboards 
        * OKR Method
    * <span style="color:red">**E**</span>xperimentation
    * <span style="color:red">**A**</span>utonomy
    * <span style="color:red">**S**</span>ocial Technologies
- <span style="color:red">**SCALE**</span> (external attributes)
    * <span style="color:red">**S**</span>taff on Demand
    * <span style="color:red">**C**</span>ommunity & Crowd

Examples for exponential organizations: 
- Google *(MTP: Organizing world’s information)*
- Airbnb *(MTP: Everyone belongs everywhere)*
- Uber
- Facebook 


Interface: AdWords
Description: User picks keywords to advertise against
Internal Usage: Google places ads against search results 
SCALE Attribute: Algorithms
