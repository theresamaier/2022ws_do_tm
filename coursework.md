Welcome to my presentation about Exponential Organizations



## what 

- What is an exponential organization?
- What is it needed for? 
- 


## Example
Lets look at google.

They developed the [exponential Organization](https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/what-is-an-exponential-organization/341439).

#intro

What have these brands in common? 
- Kodak
- Polaroid
- Blockbuster
- Nokia
Answer: all of these one-great-industry-dominant companies that were unable to adapt to rapid technological change 

*Iridium moment* --> using linear tools and the trends of the past to predict an accelerating future.

# New breed of institutional organism: *the exponential organization(ExO)*

### What circumstances have led to exponential progress becoming a survival factor for companies? 
1. neither age nor size nor reputation nor even current sales guarantee that you will be around tomorrow
2. with a minimum of resources and time you can build an organization that is sufficiently scalable, fast moving and smart (compare Airbnb, Uber)
3. Faced paced world: ([Kurzweil’s Law of Accelerating Returns](https://www.kurzweilai.net/the-law-of-accelerating-returns) and [Moore’s Law](https://www.synopsys.com/glossary/what-is-moores-law.html))
- *In ten years, 40 percent of existing Fortune 500 Companies would no longer survive.*
- The Average lifespan of an S&P 500 company has decreased from sixty-seven years in the 1920s to fifteen years today. And that lifespan is going to get even shorter in the years.

:arrow_right: **This new age calls for a different solution to building new business, to improving rates of success and to solving the challenges that lie ahead.
 Therefore: There must be a better way to organize! - An exponential one!**

## Definition:
An Exponential Organization (ExO) is one whose <span style="color:red">impact (or output) is disproportionally large—at least 10x larger—compared to its peers</span> because of the use of new organizational techniques that leverage accelerating technologies. :rocket:

 :arrow_right: Two main assumptions: 
 1. Access resources you don’t own
 2. Information is your greatest asset.

**Further characteristics:** :rocket:
- ExOs are built upon <span style="color:red">information technologies</span> that take what was once physical in nature and dematerialize it into the digital, on-demand world.

- <span style="color:red">**Massive Transformative Purpose**</span> that reflects an organization’s aspiration -> ExOs are focused on transforming the world for a better future *(not only on economic profit)*

Examples for exponential organizations: 
- Google *(MTP: Organizing world’s information)*
- Airbnb *(MTP: Everyone belongs everywhere)*
- Uber
- Facebook
