### New breed of institutional organism: *the exponential organization(ExO)*

What circumstances have led to exponential progress becoming a survival factor for companies? 
1. neither age nor size nor reputation nor even current sales guarantee that you will be around tomorrow
2. with a minimum of resources and time you can build an organization that is sufficiently scalable, fast moving and smart (compare Airbnb, Uber)
3. Faced paced world: 
- *In ten years, 40 percent of existing Fortune 500 Companies would no longer survive.*
- The Average lifespan of an S&P 500 company has decreased from sixty-seven years in the 1920s to fifteen years today. And that lifespan is going to get even shorter in the years.

--> This new age calls for a different solution to building new business, to improving rates of success and to solving the challenges that lie ahead.
 Therefore: There must be a better way to organize! - An exponential one!

**Definition:** 
An Exponential Organization (ExO) is one whose impact (or output) is disproportionally large—at least 10x larger—compared to its peers because of the use of new organizational techniques that leverage accelerating technologies.

Further characteristics: 
- ExOs are built upon information technologies that take what was once physical in nature and dematerialize it into the digital, on-demand world.

Examples for exponential organizations: 
- Google 
- Airbnb
- Uber
- Facebook
