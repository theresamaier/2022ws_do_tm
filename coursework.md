## Statements from the 2000s that you wouldn't believe were actually said that way:

|Person| *Statement*|
 --------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------| 
  |Steve Jobs (2003): | *"The subscription model for music has failed"*|
 | Paul Krugman *(Nobel Prize winner, well-known economist, advisor to several U.S. presidents)* (1998): | *"The Internet will have no more impact on the economy than the fax machine did"* | 
 |Steve Ballmer *(Ex-CEO Microsoft)* (2007):| *"The iPhone will never gain a significant market share in its lifetime. Not a chance."*|

### Theoretical Approach to an exponential Age

**Moore's Law**: *The price/performance ratio of computers is doubling every eighteen months*

**Kurzweil's Law of Accelerating Returns**: phenomenon applies to every information technology
* Once a field, discipline, technology or industry becomes information enabled and driven by information flows, the price/performance doubles approximately annually, and once that doubling starts, it doesn't stop.
* Intersecting technologies accelerate the pace of innovation even further

# New breed of institutional organism: *the exponential organization(ExO)*

| Definition:|
|--|
An Exponential Organization (ExO :rocket:) is one *"whose impact (or output) is disproportionally large—at least 10x larger—compared to its peers because of the use of new organizational techniques that leverage accelerating technologies"* (Ismail, 2014). 
➡️ There are two major assumptions on which this new way of running businesses is built:

"Rent, Don’t own Access resources you don’t own": ExOs rather use external resources than owning their own assets or workforce.
"Information accelerates everything and is therefore your greatest asset". (information-based environment delivers fundamentally disruptive opportunities)

### What circumstances have led to exponential progress becoming a survival factor for companies? 
1. neither age nor size nor reputation nor even current sales guarantee that you will be around tomorrow
2. with a minimum of resources and time you can build an organization that is sufficiently scalable, fast moving and smart (compare Airbnb, Uber)
3. Faced paced world: ([Kurzweil’s Law of Accelerating Returns](https://www.kurzweilai.net/the-law-of-accelerating-returns) and [Moore’s Law](https://www.synopsys.com/glossary/what-is-moores-law.html))
- *In ten years, 40 percent of existing Fortune 500 Companies would no longer survive.*
- The Average lifespan of an S&P 500 company has decreased from sixty-seven years in the 1920s to fifteen years today. And that lifespan is going to get even shorter in the years.

:arrow_right: **This new age calls for a different solution to building new business, to improving rates of success and to solving the challenges that lie ahead.
 Therefore: There must be a better way to organize! - An exponential one!**

## Definition:
An Exponential Organization (ExO) is one whose impact (or output) is disproportionally large—at least 10x larger—compared to its peersbecause of the use of new organizational techniques that leverage accelerating technologies. :rocket:

 :arrow_right: Two main assumptions: 
 1. Access resources you don’t own
 2. Information is your greatest asset.

**Further characteristics:** :rocket:
- ExOs are built upon <span style="color:red">information technologies</span> that take what was once physical in nature and dematerialize it into the digital, on-demand world.

- <span style="color:red">**Massive Transformative Purpose**</span> that reflects an organization’s aspiration -> ExOs are focused on transforming the world for a better future *(not only on economic profit)*

- Google *(MTP: Organizing world’s information)*
- Airbnb *(MTP: Everyone belongs everywhere)*
- Uber
- Facebook
